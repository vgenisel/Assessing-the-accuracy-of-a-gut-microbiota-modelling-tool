This repository contains data and code (in Python) to:

1) Create in silico media to replicate the feeding patterns of weaning infants (folder media)
   
2) Simulate in silico the effect of the designed media on the production of SCFA by the gut microbiota of weaning infants using the MICOM model (folder simulations)
   
3) Compare predicted outcomes with experimental data from a faecal fermentation study (folder analyses)

Steps 1 and 2 require previous installation of the MICOM model
